1.FOLDERS
Inside the tasks folder there is a file called 'all.txt'. Inside is written the number of problems. For each problem there is a seperate folder.

2.FILES
Each one contains a 'count.txt' file, containing the number of tests. Each input is named after it's id. For example, test 2 -> '2.txt'.
The same thing goes with the answers - answer test 2 -> '2a.txt'
